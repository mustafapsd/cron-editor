`cron-editor-2` is library that helps the user graphically build a CRON expression (quartz format only) in an Angular application. It is a fork of [angular-cron-gen](https://github.com/vincentjames501/angular-cron-gen) for AngularJS, ported to Angular 2+ and heavily improved.

This project contains the library along with an app to ease development and testing. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), following the awesome [Ng Library Series](https://blog.angularindepth.com/creating-a-library-in-angular-6-87799552e7e5) written by Todd Palmer.

To run the app just run `npm install`, then `npm run start` and go to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Demo

A quick demo of this app can be found [here](https://claudiuconstantin.github.io/cron-editor/).

## Sample app

This library is published as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron-editor-2) you can directly include in your app.
